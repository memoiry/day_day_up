# day_day_up

Just my little experience about preparing for university final exams, which may not suitable for anyone, but hope it may helps.

## Compile


Simply 

```bash
xelatex main.tex
```

Or you can download the project [`pdf`](https://github.com/memoiry/day_day_up/releases/download/v0.1/main.pdf) I have compiled directly. 


Enjoy!
